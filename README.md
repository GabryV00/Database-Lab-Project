# Database-Lab-Project
This repository contains the project done for the database laboratory, a course taken during the bachelor's degree in computer science.
## Goal of the project
The aim of the project is the creation of a database for the management of a wholesale goods market.
In particular, we want to keep track of the orders placed by the various departments with suppliers and with the various customers at the market. You also want to keep track of suppliers, people belonging to various departments and customers.
## Architecture

* Inside the *Python* folder we find the code for generating the .sql file for the initial population of the database.

* Inside the *R* folder we find the code for generating the graphs.

* Inside the *SQL* folder we find a file for defining tables, triggers and indexes, and a file for querying the most frequent operations.
